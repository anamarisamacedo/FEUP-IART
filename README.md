## AI solving a level

### How to run the project: 

This project was developed in Python.
To run the game, you should execute the main.py file (running python3 main.py in the command line)
Python's pygame module should be installed to run this properly.

### Game instructions

Starting the game, the user can select the option to play as a human (simply playing the game) or to play in computer mode.
In computer mode, you can choose which search method the computer should use (BFS, DFS, IDDFS or Greedy). The AI will determine the optimal solution for the level, and solve it.

### AI tips:

While playing in human mode, the AI can help you solve the level. There are two different ways to do this:

* If you lose, a screen will pop up, asking if you want to see the solution of the level (generated by the AI)
* While you're playing a level, you can press H, and the AI will determine the best moves (if any are possible) in order to solve the level.
